A machine learning model to predict Parkinson's disease from clinical data using Python. 
Conducted exploratory data analysis using visualizations like bar plots, box plots, and distribution plots to understand data distributions and relationships. 
Applied Z-score normalization to identify and remove outliers. 
Performed skewness correction using Power Transformation to ensure data was normally distributed. 
Performed feature scaling to improve model performance. 
Employed several classifiers including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Classifier (SVC). 
Conducted hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV to find the best model configurations. 
Achieved optimal performance with SVC, which was evaluated using confusion matrix, classification report, accuracy score, and Cohenâ€™s Kappa score.
